# Nerd Lights Preview PoC

This is a proof of concept showing how the same c++ source can be used to control nerd-lights from a microcontroller, and then compiled into WebAssembly to provide accurate animation previews in the browser

## Hacking
Build by executing build.sh, this will convert led_control.cpp into led_control.js and led_control.wasm.
